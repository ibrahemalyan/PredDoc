# PredDoc



# Overview

PredDoc is a machine learning-based diagnostic tool that helps doctors detect high-risk patients for heart attacks. Our project aims to address the difficulty of detecting heart attack risks in cases where symptoms are not present, which is crucial for successful treatment. By using PredDoc, doctors can improve their ability to identify patients at high risk of a heart attack and take preventive measures before it occurs.

# Problem Definition

The problem we aim to address is the difficulty of detecting high-risk patients for heart attacks, particularly in cases where symptoms are not present. Heart attacks are a leading cause of death, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. Our project targets doctors who will benefit from an improved diagnostic tool for detecting high-risk patients. Solving this problem might help save lives by allowing doctors to take preventive measures before a heart attack occurs.

# Proposed Solution

PredDoc analyzes patient data based on measurements to detect early signs of a heart attack, whether the patient is at high or low risk of a heart attack. It involves preprocessing the data and testing a dataset as well as training the three classifying algorithms with varying accuracy. By using PredDoc, doctors can improve their ability to identify patients at high risk of a heart attack.

# Accomplishments

Throughout the PredDoc project, we achieved several notable accomplishments:

Worked with real-world medical data and preprocessed it by cleaning the data.
Trained and tested different models using the preprocessed dataset and explored several different models before deciding on three different classification models, logistic regression, SVM, and GBD with varying accuracy.
Visualized the data and model performance using various techniques, such as a matrix of correlations between different features and correlations between features and response vector.
Integrated the classifier with Streamlit and learned how to add graphs and features to the website interface.
Usage

# USAGE

1-Clone the repository to your local machine.

2-Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

3-Run the app using streamlit run app.py.

4-Upload a CSV file with patient data to the app and wait for the predictions.
